# Trưa Nay Ăn Gì 🍜

Can't decide what to eat for lunch? Open a case, spin for a dish, and add a little surprise to your day.

This is the community version that runs on your computer, with no login or backend required. Filter dishes, add your own meal lists, and save your preferences in your browser.

## Run locally

You need **Node.js 22.12+** and the **pnpm** version specified in [package.json](package.json).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/truanayangi-com/truanayangi.git
cd truanayangi
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm dev
```

Open [127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000). No `.env` file or external service setup is needed. If the port is busy, run `pnpm dev -- --port 5188`.

Development commands:

```sh
pnpm test           # Run logic checks
pnpm typecheck      # Check TypeScript
pnpm lint           # Run Next.js/ESLint checks
pnpm format         # Format code with Prettier
pnpm format:check   # Verify formatting
pnpm build          # Create a production build
pnpm start          # Serve a production build at http://127.0.0.1:3000
pnpm preview        # Alias for pnpm start
```

The Next.js servers bind to `127.0.0.1` only. Run `pnpm build` before `pnpm start` or `pnpm preview`. Once dependencies are installed, the app loads its assets locally; external links open only when you click them.

## Your data

Preferences, meal lists, and spin counts are saved automatically in cookies in your current browser. Clearing cookies resets this data; it does not sync across devices. The displayed spin count belongs to this browser only.

If cookies are blocked or a meal list is too large, the app will let you know it could not save.

## GitHub Pages and the official website

GitHub Pages only redirects to https://truanayangi.com/. This keeps functionality consistent: visitors always use the same production frontend, API, and same-origin login cookie instead of a second static app that can drift or lose authentication on refresh. Publish only `pages-redirect/` to `gh-pages`; do not deploy the local build there. Shared static UI and reel-motion fixes should be updated in both this repository and the private production frontend.
